Notes:  Hi Dr. Nico, we unfortuantely were not able to get as far with the 
        testcases we would have liked to. We got a lot of code implemented,
        but our main downfall was not being able to succesfully implement 
        the optional 4th argument, and concatening name with prefix (prefix
        showed up blank for some reason). We ended up not having enough time
        to test and debug everything. 

        For c, we were able to write code but never got to test it as we 
        prioritized x and t. 

        For t, we believe that our code is able to support the full 
        functionality as described in the spec. However, when running into 
        tar files where the name attribute of the file was greater than 100 
        bytes, we ran into an "overflow" error preventing us to print out the 
        original file name correctly, even though the otherparameters in the 
        "verbose" case were correct.

        For x, we were able to implement code that could extract files from
        tars that had one or more files. We did not have time to implement it
        any further for the other requirements, including the optional name 
        argument.
